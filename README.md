**The House Edge** is a professional intelligence platform that treats football analytics with the rigor of high-frequency financial trading. Originally built for betting intelligence, it is now pivoted toward **Player Value Detection** and **Recruitment ROI**.

### 🏗️ Moving From Betting to Moneyball
The same math that detects "Sharp Money" in betting markets detects "Undervalued Talent" in football scouting.
- **Sharp Money Detection:** Identifying when the "smart money" moves on a team/player before the public.
- **Algorithmic Bankroll Management:** Applying the Kelly Criterion to recruitment budgets to maximize tactical ROI.
- **Agentic Risk Guard:** A multi-agent swarm that ensures no recruitment move is made without clearing specific risk thresholds.

### ⚽ Club Impact
- **Recruitment Optimization:** Finding the "hidden gems" in regional leagues using betting-derived efficiency metrics.
- **Budget Protection:** Ensuring every dollar spent on transfers is backed by a multi-agent risk assessment.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core:** Clojure (High-concurrency analysis)
- **Engine:** Multi-Agent Swarm (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma agents)
- **Interface:** ROI Management Dashboard
